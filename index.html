YouTube playlists built from BoB comments area

These are extracted from the comments area of www.bolhabrasil.org (AKA BoB)
posts. Each file represents one post; its name is part of the permalink
(everything that goes after the "/").

Inside each file there are TinyURL links, each pointing to one playlist.
YouTube has a limit of 50 videos per anonymous playlist, so if I could scrape
more than 50 links, there will be more than one TinyURL link.

I am not BoB admin. People from that blog can use these playlists as a
starting point to create a more-than-50-videos playlist in their own YouTube
account.
